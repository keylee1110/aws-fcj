During my internship at **AWS (First Cloud Journey)** from **September** to **December**, I had the opportunity to learn, 
practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  

I participated in the **Capstone Project**, through which I improved my skills in 
**cloud architecture, serverless development, and teamwork**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Needs Improvement.

* **Communication:** Need to be more confident when presenting technical ideas to a larger audience.
* **Time Management:** Sometimes got stuck too long on a single bug; need to balance time better.
* **Deep Technical Depth:** While I learned many services, I need to dive deeper into networking nuances.
