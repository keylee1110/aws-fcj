### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is incredibly supportive. I felt welcomed from day one. The open-office layout fosters collaboration, although it can sometimes get a bit noisy during peak hours.

**2. Support from Mentors**  
My mentors were outstanding. They didn't just give me the answers; they guided me on how to find them myself. Their industry insights were invaluable.

**3. Relevance to Career Goals**  
This internship perfectly matched my goal of becoming a Cloud Architect. The hands-on labs and real-world projects bridged the gap between my academic theory and industry practice.

**4. Skill Development**  
I significantly improved my AWS technical skills, specifically in serverless architectures. I also learned soft skills like time management and effective communication.

### Additional Questions

- **What are you most satisfied with?**
  The access to premium AWS learning resources and the opportunity to attend exclusive events like the Cloud Day.

- **What should be improved?**
  Perhaps more structured documentation for the initial project setup would be helpful for new joiners.

- **Would you recommend this internship?**
  Absolutely. It's a fast-track to learning Cloud Computing properly.

### Suggestions
