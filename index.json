The goal is to help beginners understand how networking works in the cloud, and how different components connect together to form a secure, controlled environment.\nYou will create a VPC with two subnets:\nA Public Subnet – allows resources (like EC2 instances) to access the Internet directly. A Private Subnet – isolated from the public Internet by default for better security. To enable the private subnet to download packages and access online services without being exposed publicly, you will configure:\nAn Internet Gateway (IGW) – allows public subnet traffic to flow to/from the Internet. An NAT Gateway – lets instances in the private subnet access the Internet indirectly, without assigning a public IP. By the end, you will spin up two EC2 instances — one in each subnet — and test communication between them while observing the role of routing and gateways.\nThis hands-on workshop teaches essential AWS networking fundamentals through guided steps and console navigation. Perfect for beginners who want to build confidence working with VPCs.\n"},{"uri":"https://keylee1110.github.io/aws-fcj/1-worklog/1.1-week1/","title":"Week 1 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 1 Objectives: Connect and network with members of First Cloud Journey.

It calculates a Fit Score, detects skill gaps, and provides personalized learning suggestions.\nThe solution is implemented by a 5‑member team in 4 weeks on AWS using managed, pay‑as‑you‑go services to keep costs near zero for a demo workload. The UI is built with Next.js and hosted on AWS Amplify; the backend uses API Gateway + Lambda with DynamoDB, S3, Comprehend, Textract, and Cognito.\nKey outcomes\n90% faster CV screening for demo scenarios. Objective Fit Score with visual reports. Actionable learning roadmap per candidate. 2) Problem Statement 2.1 What’s the problem? Recruiters spend significant time manually reading CVs and comparing them to JDs. Candidates lack insight into which skills they are missing and how to improve. Existing tools are expensive or not tailored for Vietnamese/SEA use cases. 2.2 The solution Upload CV (PDF/DOCX) and JD → automatic text extraction and NLP. Detect skills, experience, education; compute Fit Score vs JD. Recommend skill pathways mapped from a small SkillOntology store. Secure login with Cognito; results shown in a clean Next.js dashboard. 3) Solution Architecture (overview) Serverless, event‑driven architecture on AWS.\nMain components\nFrontend: Next.js UI (Amplify Hosting) for upload \u0026amp; result dashboard. API Layer: Amazon API Gateway → AWS Lambda functions. Processing: parseResume → Textract (if scanned PDF) → normalized text. nlpAnalyze → Comprehend → entities/skills/phrases. recommendSkills → compares to JD + SkillOntology in DynamoDB. Data: DynamoDB (results, ontology), S3 (temporary CV/JD). Identity: Cognito (JWT access tokens). Ops: IaC with AWS SAM, CI/CD via CodeBuild + CodePipeline, logging in CloudWatch. (A Mermaid architecture diagram is provided separately.)\n4) Technical Implementation 4.1 Tech stack Backend: .NET 8 (C# Minimal API on Lambda) Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS (Amplify Hosting) AWS: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Comprehend, Textract IaC: AWS SAM CI/CD: CodeBuild + CodePipeline 4.2 End‑to‑end flow User authenticates via Cognito and obtains JWT. Frontend requests presigned URL to S3 → uploads CV/JD. API Gateway invokes Lambda parseResume: If PDF scan → Textract → extract text; otherwise direct parse. Clean \u0026amp; normalize → store interim artifacts on S3. Lambda nlpAnalyze uses Comprehend to detect entities/skills → writes results to DynamoDB. Lambda recommendSkills loads SkillOntology from DynamoDB → compares CV vs JD → computes Fit Score + gaps. Frontend queries results via API → renders charts/tables. 4.3 Data model (DynamoDB – simplified) Table Profiles (PK: userId, SK: profileId) – store latest CV parse. Table Analyses (PK: analysisId) – fit score, gaps, timestamps. Table SkillOntology (PK: skillId, attributes: name, tags, learningPath[]). 4.4 API (high level) POST /upload-url → presign for CV/JD. POST /analyze → triggers pipeline for a given S3 key pair. GET /analyses/{id} → returns Fit Score \u0026amp; recommendations. GET /skills/{id} → (optional) fetch a skill’s learning path. 5) Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones (4 weeks) Week Milestone Deliverables 1 Foundation SAM template, DynamoDB tables, Cognito, base UI 2 Parsing \u0026amp; NLP parseResume, nlpAnalyze, JD parsing, unit tests 3 Recommender \u0026amp; FE integration recommendSkills, dashboard, charts 4 Demo \u0026amp; hardening E2E tests, logging, cost tuning, slide deck 6) Budget Estimation (demo scale) Indicative, assuming \u0026lt; 500 requests/month\nLambda: ~$0.02 API Gateway: ~$0.01 S3 (few GB, low requests): ~$0.10 DynamoDB (on‑demand, low R/W): ~$0.05 Amplify Hosting: ~$0.30 Comprehend + Textract (small pages): ~$0.40 Cognito: $0.00\nTotal ≈ $0.9 / month (~$10 / year) 7) Security, Risks \u0026amp; Mitigations Security\nPrivate S3 buckets with SSE‑KMS; presigned uploads only. IAM least privilege; API protected by Cognito JWT. PII masking for logs; CloudWatch alarms. Optional: set lifecycle rules to delete raw CV/JD after analysis. Risks \u0026amp; mitigations\nNLP accuracy: Provide supported formats + fallback to keyword rules. Large/unclean CVs: Validate size/format; sanitize before NLP. Cost spikes: AWS Budget alarms; cap page counts per request. 8) Expected Outcomes Automated CV‑JD matching with transparent Fit Score. Visual breakdown of skills matched vs gaps and learning roadmap. Serverless, low‑ops stack that’s easy to demo, extend, and localize. 📄 Proposal Document (Google Docs) 👉 Review Proposal here:\nGOOGLE DOC LINK\n"},{"uri":"https://keylee1110.github.io/aws-fcj/5-workshop/5.3-vpc-subnets/","title":"Create VPC &amp; Subnets","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Create VPC \u0026amp; Subnets In this component, you will create your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and define two subnets:\n1 Public Subnet (Internet accessible) 1 Private Subnet (no direct Internet access) 3.1 Create the VPC Open AWS Management Console Navigate to Services → VPC Click Create VPC Select VPC Only Enter the details: Name tag: Workshop-VPC IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 Keep all other settings at default Click Create VPC 3.2 Create Public Subnet In the left menu, click Subnets Click Create subnet Configure as follows: VPC: Workshop-VPC Subnet name: Public-Subnet Availability Zone: (any, example: ap-southeast-1a) IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24 Click Create subnet 3.3 Create Private Subnet Click Create subnet again Fill in the values: VPC: Workshop-VPC Subnet name: Private-Subnet Availability Zone: (can be same or different) IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.2.0/24 Click Create subnet This process is similar to 3.2 with only minor differences.

Working Environment\nThe working environment at FCJ is incredibly supportive. I felt welcomed from day one. The open-office layout fosters collaboration, although it can sometimes get a bit noisy during peak hours.\n2. Support from Mentors\nMy mentors were outstanding. They didn\u0026rsquo;t just give me the answers; they guided me on how to find them myself. Their industry insights were invaluable.\n3. Relevance to Career Goals\nThis internship perfectly matched my goal of becoming a Cloud Architect. The hands-on labs and real-world projects bridged the gap between my academic theory and industry practice.\n4. Skill Development\nI significantly improved my AWS technical skills, specifically in serverless architectures. I also learned soft skills like time management and effective communication.\nAdditional Questions What are you most satisfied with? The access to premium AWS learning resources and the opportunity to attend exclusive events like the Cloud Day.\nWhat should be improved? Perhaps more structured documentation for the initial project setup would be helpful for new joiners.\nWould you recommend this internship? Absolutely. It\u0026rsquo;s a fast-track to learning Cloud Computing properly.\nSuggestions Improvement: Organize more technical deep-dive sessions on specific advanced topics like Advanced Networking or Security. Future: I hope to stay connected with the FCJ community. Thank you, FCJ Team, for this amazing journey!\n"},{"uri":"https://keylee1110.github.io/aws-fcj/1-worklog/1.7-week7/","title":"Week 7 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 7 Objectives: Advanced Networking (VPC Peering, Route 53).
